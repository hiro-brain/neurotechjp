## Using Biomarkers to Improve Breaks and Focus

Adam discusses the use of biomarkers to help individuals take better breaks and improve their focus.

> How can we use these biomarkers to help people take better breaks that people are actually not as good at taking breaks as they think they are.

&nbsp;

He emphasizes that **people often work themselves to exhaustion and are not as good at taking breaks as they think**. Neurable aims to utilize intelligent biomarkers from brain activity to enhance well-being, destigmatize break culture, and improve overall productivity.

&nbsp;

## Hands-Free Control of Augmented Reality Systems and the Future of Neurable

Adam highlights the importance of **hands-free control in augmented reality (AR) systems and the potential shift in computing paradigms with the rise of AR and virtual reality (VR)**. He mentions ongoing conversations and projects related to partnering with medical or clinical studies, indicating Neurable’s commitment to incorporating control features into their product.

> For me, I think also hands-free control of augmented reality systems when they become ubiquitous will be very important.

## Neurable’s Approach to Data Ethics and Privacy in Neurotech

Adam addresses concerns about privacy in neurotech and emphasizes Neurable’s commitment to data ethics. He assures that **data collected will primarily be used for the benefit of the individual and that measures are in place to protect and safeguard the data**. Compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA is a priority for Neurable.

> We want to safeguard it from the source, meaning the person, and then using that to enforce privacy considerations moving forward.

&nbsp;

## Making Brain Measurements Ubiquitous

The ultimate goal of Neurable is to **make brain measurements more accessible**, aiming to create a world without limitations. Adam envisions a future where neurotechnology becomes an equalizing force.

> How can we use these devices, these tools, these systems to help overcome that and give ourselves some kind of an equalizing force?
