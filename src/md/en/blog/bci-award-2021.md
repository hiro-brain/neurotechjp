NeurotechJP has been providing a lot of contents on how to apply Neurotechnology to business, such as [column articles on startups active in Neurotech industry](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/) and [industry analysis report](https://neurotechjp.com/slides/).

However, at the root of these business applications, the development of technology is indispensable.

The [BCI Award](https://www.bci-award.com/Home) is a competition to select the most innovative BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) research and projects in the world, and the Top 3 research projects are selected from 12 nominated projects each year.

In the [BCI Award 2021](https://www.bci-award.com/2021), the results of which were announced in mid-October, innovative technology research were awarded.

In this article, we will explain the Top2 research/projects of this year's BCI Award in an easy-to-understand manner.

&nbsp;

## What is BCI Award

The BCI Award is held annually and is now in its 12th year. The range of sponsors is wide, including [g.tec](https://www.gtec.at/), which has been providing BCI for several decades, Neurotech's research media [IEEE Brain](https://brain.ieee.org/), Neurotech's largest community [NeurotechX](http://neurotechx.com/), and Riken's [AIP (Advanced Intelligence Project)](https://aip.riken.jp/) from Japan.

The 12 nominated research projects will be ranked by a panel of seven judges, including university professors and the previous year's winner, and the first place team will receive $3000.

&nbsp;

## 1st place: "Stentrode", a component of the Synchron brain-computer interface

The first-place winner this time is the research team at [Synchron](https://synchron.com/). As mentioned in [5 featured startups in Invasive BCI](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/5-startups-invasive-bci/), Synchron is an invasive BCI company that is attracting attention as a competitor to Neuralink.

Synchron's core technology, [Stentrode](https://synchron.com/stentrode), is a fully implantable medical device for paraplegics that can transmit brain signals from inside blood vessels.

&nbsp;

Noteworthy is the fact that it is **minimally invasive and can capture brain activity with multiple sensors**.

Implanting Synchron's Stentrode requires about two hours of surgery, but since the device is inserted through a blood vessel in the neck and moved within the blood vessel to the location of the brain, **no brain surgery is required**. The minimally invasive nature of the surgery gives patients peace of mind and enables the company to provide the device to a large number of people. In July of this year, the company received [FDA approval for Stentrode's use in clinical trials](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210728005305/en/Synchron-Receives-Green-Light-From-FDA) in July of this year, making it the first company to offer an invasive BCI.

&nbsp;

Stentrode is also designed to **capture brain activity related to the patient's intended movement, and the device's numerous sensors can record activity at multiple locations in the brain**.

By attaching a special transmitter to the chest, the brain activity data acquired from the Stentrode can be transmitted to a computer and connected to a dedicated software platform. With repeated training, the user will be able to type messages with just a thought, and also perform daily tasks such as shopping and internet banking without any inconvenience.

## 2nd place: A direct-speech BCI for decoding words and sentences in a person with severe paralysis andanarthria

The [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) led by [Edward Chang](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang), a professor of neurosurgery at UCSF, won second place.

They conducted **[research on an invasive BCI that can decode intended thoughts in real-time to help people with dysarthria and severe paralysis regain smooth communication](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027540).**

&nbsp;

In this research, electrodes were implanted in the area of the brain that controls the vocal tract, and subjects were asked to attempt to speak their answers to questions shown on a display. By acquiring the brain waves during the process and combining multiple algorithms such as speech detection, word classification, and language modeling, in addition to signal processing algorithms, it was possible to translate words and sentences in real-time.

&nbsp;

Noteworthy is the fact that it is possible to decode **not only words but also sentences from brain activity while attempting to speak**.

Research of this kind is often divided into two patterns: research that decodes words and sentences from brain activity during actual speech, and research that decodes words and sentences from brain activity while the person with a disability is attempting to speak.

Their current research is in the latter pattern, and they are the first in the world to succeed in "**decoding sentences**" with high accuracy, which has been considered difficult in the past.

&nbsp;

Their algorithm is trained to distinguish 50 words and is capable of producing **more than 1000 sentences**.

They were also able to decode **15 words per minute** with an average accuracy of **74%**.

&nbsp;

The lab is also studying patterns of [decoding words and sentences from brain activity during actual speech](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/04/414296/synthetic-speech-generated-brain-recordings) and, and patterns of speech synthesis from neural decoding.

The lab has not only won the BCI Award, but has also [collaborated with Facebook (now Meta) on research](https://tech.fb.com/bci-milestone-new-research-from-ucsf-with-support-from-facebook-shows-the-potential-of-brain-computer-interfaces-for-restoring-speech-communication/).

## Conclusion

In this article, we have presented two studies that were awarded the BCI Award 2021.

Both the first and second place winning researches are invasive BCI researches, which are innovative developments in the technology of decoding thoughts from brain activity.

The third-place winning research team, whose paper is not available to the public, was working on a non-invasive BCI that classifies finger movements based on EEG (electroencephalogram).

&nbsp;

Research-based technological developments like Synchron's will make Neurotech more feasible for us consumers.

We will continue to keep an eye on these latest researches.
