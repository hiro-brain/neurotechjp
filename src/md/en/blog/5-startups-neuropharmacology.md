## Introduction

Neuropharmacology is **the study of both the treatment of curing sick people and improving their moods for the better.** Hence, it applies to everything from drugs prescribed to help the sick to the latest **"smart drugs"**.

As introduced in [10 Technologies Representing Neurotech ~ First Half ~](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/10-major-types-of-neurotech/), the field of neuropharmacology is broadly divided into two categories: molecular neuropharmacology and behavioral neuropharmacology. The development of new drugs takes a great deal of time and money, but nevertheless, the investment is made because the benefits are just as great.

According to a report by [Neurotech Analytics](https://www.neurotech.com/), the majority of the Neurotech market is dominated by companies that apply Neuropharmacology technology. In this article, we would like to highlight five of the companies that are growing in size and taking unique approaches.

## [1. Sage Therapeutics](https://www.sagerx.com/)

[Sage Therapeutics](https://www.sagerx.com/) is a company that is developing new drugs that could change the lives of people with brain health disorders.

The company has been working with the neurotransmitter system [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid) and [NMDA receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor).

These two neurotransmitter systems are said to play a major role in the regulation of central nervous system functions and they are working on the treatment of various neurological disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, essential tremor, and Parkinson's disease, in addition to depression, using their own developmental approach.

## Conclusion

In this article, we introduced companies that utilize Neuropharmacology technology.

While there are many companies that develop new drugs, each of them offers new drugs for patients with different diseases, and there are also many unique companies that combine technology, such as BlackThorn Therapeutics, which uses data analysis technology to develop new drugs.

Their research and efforts may make it possible to treat diseases that have been said to be difficult to treat with drugs in the future.
