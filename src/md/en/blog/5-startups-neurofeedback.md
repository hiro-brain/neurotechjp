Our brains are constantly evolving. Especially in childhood, the brain learns and evolves through first-hand experiences.

This change in the function and structure of the brain in response to stimuli is called "**[Neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)"**.

There are billions of pathways running through our brains that are accessed every time we think, feel, or act, and some of them are very fast. They correspond to habits, that is, established ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. However, when we think or learn something different, new pathways are opened up, and if we keep learning over and over again, our brain will use those pathways more frequently. As a result, the unusual thought, action, or learning becomes a new habit, which is how neuroplasticity works.

One way to realize neuroplasticity is a technology called **"Neurofeedback, " which visualizes brain wave activity in real-time, and by training it, changes the brain waves and leads to self-regulation of brain functions.**

As introduced in [10 Technologies Representing Neurotech - First Half -](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/10-major-types-of-neurotech/), neurofeedback can be used to treat **various neurological disorders** such as ADHD. In addition, neurofeedback can also be used to **improve concentration and productivity at work**.

&nbsp;

In this article, we will introduce selected five startups that are developing unique solutions based on neurofeedback technology.

&nbsp;

## [1. Myndlift](https://www.myndlift.com/)

[Myndlift](https://www.myndlift.com/) is a startup that provides **kits and applications for neurofeedback that can be used with the brainwave device [Muse](https://choosemuse.com/).**

_Video: Myndlift Introduction_

&nbsp;

The application they provide allows you to train your brain through several games to **improve concentration** and **relaxation effects**. In addition, their proprietary device kit includes **additional electrodes** that can be worn in any position in addition to the electrodes on the Muse to **enhance the accuracy of neurofeedback**.

Furthermore, users can also take advantage of online sessions where they can receive monthly professional consultations.

&nbsp;

The company's technology is in use at **more than hundreds of neurofeedback clinics worldwide,** and its training has been used in **more than 300,000 sessions (approximately 7 million minutes).**

## [3. Sana Health](https://www.sana.io/)

[Sana Health](https://www.sana.io/) is a startup that offers **a device that uses innovative audio-visual technology to accelerate improvement in terms of physical recovery as well as mental health**.

[![Sana Health Introduction](https://neurotechjp.com/img/5-startups-neurofeedback/sana-health.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7vZZiqgn4KU)
_Video: Sana Health Introduction_

&nbsp;

The company's device, "Sana Mask," provides audio-visual stimulation to **increase the balance between the left and right brain and induce a state of deep relaxation.**

In addition to a sensor that can measure heart rate, the mask has a built-in device that can transmit low-level light stimulation even when the eyes are closed. The device pulses light and sound with a specific algorithm and stimulates based on the individual's heart rate, thereby regulating the nervous system and providing a sense of security.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have introduced five companies that have applied neurofeedback technology.

While the purpose of providing mental support is a common use case for neurofeedback, the uniqueness comes from how it is realized and what kind of interface is provided to the user.

We can expect to see more and more creative companies like Healium applying neurofeedback to VR, and others like Neuromore providing SaaS and platforms.
