There are about 86 billion [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) in the brain, and the activity of these neurons controls our lives.
One method of acquiring and analyzing the activity of neurons as EEG is called [VEP (Visual Evoked Potentials)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential#Visual_evoked_potential). This is a method of analyzing EEG based on visual information. (There are also other methods such as P300)

This time, I would like to introduce you to [Masaki Nakanishi](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~masaki/) who is working as a Project Scientist at [SCCN](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/), which is a research facility at UC San Diego that conducts world-class research on VEP, through an interview with his trajectory and the potential of VEP.

### Went to UCSD for seeking higher technology

When I asked him what got him interested in neurotechnology, he told me,
"While a student at Keio University in Japan, I gained an insight into a brain computer interface from a class project titled 'What is the ultimate interface?'. A few years later, I became involved in the research of [BCI(Brain Computer Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) in Ph.D. at Keio University."

After receiving a Ph.D. in Japan, he decided to work as a researcher at UCSD to pursue higher technology.
At the SCCN research facility, he researched BCI and made many achievements, including setting a world record in the field of SSVEP, one of the VEP methods.

### SSVEP to be applied in medical and AR/VR industries

As mentioned above, Mr.Nakanishi's research team set a new world record in BCI using [SSVEP (Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_visually_evoked_potential)-based BCI.

SSVEP is an EEG component evoked by visual stimuli flashing on the screen. We can identify the stimuli by comparing the frequency of the flashing stimuli on the screen with the frequency of the responding EEG. For example, if there are letters A to Z flashing at different frequencies on the screen, we can identify the letter the subject is looking at by analyzing the frequency that appears in the EEG.

Mr.Nakanishi said that the reason why he could set a world record is that
his team had succeeded in increasing the rate of information transfer, a measure of the world record, by solving existing problems such as the limited frequency of stimuli that can be generated on a computer screen.

&nbsp;

So, how can this technology be used in our daily lives?

I asked him about its possibilities.

&nbsp;

Mr.Nakanishi said, "First of all, it is being applied to the medical industry.
Even people who have difficulty moving their arms and legs can use this technology by attaching a device to their brain to accurately convey the words they want to say."

&nbsp;

Also, Mr.Nakanishi said, "AR/VR is the next field to be effectively utilized.
By displaying stimuli, which are used to be displayed on a screen on a computer, on the screen of AR glasses or VR, it will be possible to expand the input options for AR/VR.

For example, if multiple buttons are displayed on Google Glass, you can select any button by going through the steps of 'look â†’ measure brain waves'".

Because SSVEP can accurately detect what is gazing, unlike eye-tracking and other technologies that have been used in AR glasses, it can respond to small targets and can distinguish between gazing at the actual outside world and gazing at the digital world on the glasses.

In addition, Mr.Nakanishi mentioned that, although brain wave measurement devices cause unnaturalness when worn on a daily basis, embedding electrodes that can measure brain waves in AR/VR head-mounted devices will make them more compatible in terms of convenience.

&nbsp;

### Future trends in Neurotechnology

Mr.Nakanishi told me, in order to incorporate neurotechnology more into our daily lives, there is still a lot of progress that needs to be made, such as improving the way of stimulation in SSVEP, in addition to developing more accurate and slimmer sensors and devices.

In addition, Mr.Nakanishi predicts that not only existing EEG analysis methods such as VEP and P300, but also new analysis methods with high accuracy in real-time technology to estimate from which part of the brain the EEG originates (i.e., signal source estimation) will be the key in the future.

&nbsp;

### In the end

This time, I had the pleasure of interviewing Masaki Nakanishi, who is conducting research on a technology called VEP at UCSD.

The day may soon come when the sensory experience of vision is combined with brain waves to revolutionize our digital world of smartphones, VR, and IoT.
