NeurotechJP has been introducing various products and content through interviews. As we mentioned in [an Interview article with Morgan Hough](https://www.neurotechjp.com/blog/morgan-neurotechsf/), openness in sharing is as important as software for the spread of neurotech. In this article, we have listed all the learning contents for beginners around the world, especially BCI, which is one of the most popular Neurotech.

&nbsp;

## [1. BCI Guys](https://www.bciguys.com/home)

The [BCI Guys](https://www.bciguys.com/home) provides content that could be called an introduction to BCI. They explain the basics of neuroscience and the concept of neurotech in an easy-to-understand manner through Youtube videos. As you can see in the [BCI Guys course list](https://www.bciguys.com/course), from Lesson 1 to Lesson 10, the course covers the following topics: introduction and history of neurotechnology, basic neuroanatomy, brain function and neuroscience, types of neurotechnology, and neuroscience. Neurotechnology types, neuromodulation and brain function enhancement, BCI and methods, neuroethics and cultural considerations, and industry players.

[NeurotechJP interviewed Harrison Canning, the head of the BCI Guys](https://www.neurotechjp.com/blog/harrison-canning-rit/). They are planning to work with corporate sponsors to put out videos on the implementation part.

&nbsp;

## [2. NeurotechX](https://neurotechx.com/)

[NeurotechX](https://neurotechx.com/) is an international community for neurotech enthusiasts. The three pillars of NeurotechX are (1) community, (2) education, and (3) professional development.
The most notable of NeurotechX's contents is the implementation-focused [NeurotechEDU](http://learn.neurotechedu.com/lessons/), which provides implementation-focused educational content related to EEG and an introduction to neuroscience.

In addition, the [EEG notebook](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) in the [NeurotechX Github repo](https://github.com/NeuroTechX) is a very good resource. It is a very comprehensive resource and contains sample codes for almost all EEG-related experiments, such as P300, SSVEP, and so on. Also not to be missed is [awesome-bci](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci), a collection of implementation tools, libraries, platforms, and datasets.

&nbsp;

## [3. Neurotech Berkeley](https://neurotech.berkeley.edu/)

[Neurotech Berkeley](https://neurotech.berkeley.edu/) is an organization run by members of the University of California Berkeley, where Carmena Lab is located, as previously mentioned in [5 Featured University Labs/Facilities in BCI](https://www.neurotechjp.com/blog/5-bci-labs-facilities/).
It is divided into [six divisions](https://neurotech.berkeley.edu/divisions.html#): software, devices, consulting, outreach, publication, and education, with a focus on EEG, TMS, and fMRI. divisions.

Neurotech Berkeley's content is basically organized on Github, with [Neurotech-Course](https://github.com/neurotech-berkeley/neurotech-course) containing links to slides and videos as well as tutorials on signal analysis and other topics in Jupyter notebook, Python data analysis, and the [fMRI Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1). This is a great resource for those who are interested in using TMS and fMRI in their research.

&nbsp;

## [4. Spring school by G.tec](https://www.gtec.at/)

[g.tec medical engineering](https://www.gtec.at/) has been developing and manufacturing high-performance BCI and neurotechnology for both invasive and non-invasive recording for research and clinical use since 1999. g.tec offers [SPRING SCHOOL](https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2022/), a 10-day online educational program that provides 5-6 hours of daily instruction using g.tec products. In fact, the seminar originally cost 980 EURO (about 120,000 yen), but it was offered for free by Corona Peripherals 2021. It is already available on Youtube.

In addition, [BR41N.IO](https://www.br41n.io/)(stands for THE BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE DESIGNERS HACKATHON), a hackathon since 2017, and [webinars every Monday](https://www.gtec.at/product/webinars/%EF%BF%A5). [SPRING SCHOOL 2022](https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2022/) will also be held starting April 30, Vienna time.

&nbsp;

## [5. Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/)

[Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/) is an online community run by an American non-profit organization. It operates two organizations, [Neuromatch Academy](http://academy.neuromatch.io/) and [Neuromatch Conference](http://academy.neuromatch.io/), whose mission is to facilitate inclusive, global interaction for learning, mentorship, networking, and professional development.

![Neuromatch](https://neurotechjp.com/img/5-learning-contents-bci/neuromatch.jpg)

[Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) is divided into [NMA-CN(Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience)](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content) for computational neuroscience and [NMA-DL(Neuromatch Deep Learning)](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl) for deep learning. The syllabus for each is available on Github. These contents are organized into [a 15-day Summer School curriculum](https://academy.neuromatch.io/nma2020/course-materials), where you can learn together with people from all over the world.

The [Neuromatch Conference](http://conference.neuromatch.io/) is a conference for the computational neuroscience community, and If you check the [agenda](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/nmc4), you will find that it is divided into keynotes, panel sessions, short talks, and flash talks, which can be viewed through the [Cloudcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/nmc4) service. There is also a [Discord server](https://conference.neuromatch.io/instructions/how-to-discord/) where you can ask questions and discuss each talk.

&nbsp;

## In conclusion

In addition to the contents introduced here, the Python library [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) has an extensive tutorial for analyzing brain waves, and [OpenBCI,](https://docs.openbci.com/) which is a sponsor of NeurotechX, provides a good tutorial on how to use OpenBCI. There is no doubt that the development of this industry is brought about by a culture of openness.

On the other hand, there will be ethical issues in handling the brain, which is very sensitive and can be the ultimate personal information, as open data. For those who are going to learn Neurotech/BCI, we would like them to learn from the contents introduced in this article while balancing the importance of ELSI( Ethical, Legal and Social Issues).
