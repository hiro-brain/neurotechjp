## Introduction

As introduced in [5 featured Startups in Neurotech](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/5-startups-of-interest/), BCI can be broadly classified into three types: invasive, semi-invasive, and non-invasive. The "invasive" type of BCI introduced here is a technology that makes many things possible by implanting devices directly into the brain through surgery.

&nbsp;
Currently, there are more than 1,500 neurotech-related companies listed on [NeurotechX](http://neurotechx.com/), but only 45 of them are actually involved in the application of invasive BCI.

Among the invasive BCI companies, [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) leads the market in terms of size and popularity, but there are many companies that have been providing BCI using this technology long before them.

&nbsp;

In this article, we will introduce some of the startups that have made significant progress in their technology and vision to compete with Neuralink, along with their remarkable features and visions.

&nbsp;

## [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/)

Before explaining Neuralink's competitors, I would like to first introduce Neuralink's value proposition and technical background that is making a lot of buzz in this market.

&nbsp;

The company recently announced that it has raised [an additional $205M in Series C funding](https://neuralink.com/blog/series-c/), and what's remarkable is its **investment team**. [Vy Capital](https://www.vycapital.com/) is the lead VC firm, with six other firms including [Google Ventures](https://www.gv.com/). As for angels, [Sam Altman](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-altman) (Chairman of [YC Group](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and CEO of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) ), [Fred Ehrsam](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/fred-ehrsam) (Co-founder of [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)), [Ken Howery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Howery)(Co-founder of [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) and [Founders Fund](https://foundersfund.com/)), and other investors who have a strong relationship with Elon Musk.

&nbsp;

The reason behind the large funding is to accelerate Neuralink's vision and as a means to do so, to accelerate technology development and R&D.

The company's vision is to provide BCIs to help people with paralysis, and to expand our abilities and our world. [According to Shivon Zills, Director of Operations at the company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2RA3lzZ9PA&feature=youtu.be), they are thinking of **2033 - 2036 as a guideline for providing devices to healthy humans**.

It is no exaggeration to say that Neuralink is leading not only in popularity but also in **technology**.

By implanting Link, a device about the size of a coin, into the brain, it is possible to control a smartphone by simply thinking about it through mobile apps provided by the company. What is remarkable is that the company has also developed a robot that can perform the implantation procedure automatically. By using a robot to perform the surgery automatically, instead of using human hands, the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of the surgery can be guaranteed, and Neuralink devices can be provided to more people.

## [Paradromics](https://www.paradromics.com/)

Paradromics is a startup that provides **a device called "Connexus" that restores communication to patients who have lost the ability to speak due to severe paralysis.**

![Connexus device](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWVJ0IgbMVG0/v0/150x-1.jpg)

The company [raised $20M in seed funding in July of this year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/neuralink-competitor-raises-20-million-for-brain-implants), and its technology and growth speed have positioned it as a major competitor to Neuralink.

With this funding, the company will implement the feature to convert bioelectrical signals into digital signals for computers by using brain-implantable microwires connected to a device in the chest.

Last year, the company [implanted more than 30,000 electrodes in the cerebral cortex of sheep to perform **the biggest brain activity experiment ever**](https://www.paradromics.com/news/paradromics-unveils-the-largest-ever-electrical-recordings-in-cortex/). The recordings enabled high-fidelity observation of the sheep's brain activity in response to sound stimuli, demonstrating the effectiveness of Connexus.

## [Synchron](https://synchron.com/)

Synchron is a startup that offers **a small device called "Stentrode™" that is implanted in a blood vessel for patients with paralysis**. The implantation requires about two hours of surgery, but the device is inserted through a blood vessel in the neck and moved within the blood vessel to the location of the brain, so it can be implanted **without any incisions**.

[![Synchron Intro](https://neurotechjp.com/img/5-startups-invasive-bci/synchron.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mm95r05hui0)
_Video: Synchron intro_

The company, like Neuralink and Paradromics, offers an experience of controlling a computer with just a thought using its own invasive BCI, but it is ahead of other companies in terms of **speed to commercial use**.

In order to sell a device like the BCI that works on the human body in the U.S., the company needs to demonstrate its capabilities and safety to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) and get approval. **The company got approval from the FDA in July of this year**. This is the **first time that a commercial invasive BCI company has been approved by the FDA**, and it is a step ahead of other competitors such as Neuralink, which has yet to receive approval from the FDA.

Later this year, the company plans to conduct a clinical trial of Stentrode™ in six subjects at a hospital in New York.

&nbsp;

The company has already begun clinical trials with four patients in Australia, where it has confirmed that it can "transfer data from the motor cortex of the brain through electrodes to control digital devices.

## [Iota Biosciences](https://iota.bio/)

iota biosciences is a startup that provides **millimeter-sized ultrasound-driven invasive devices**. The company was founded by [Jose Carmena](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jose-carmena), a professor of electrical engineering and neuroscience at UC Berkeley. It is the world's first BCI device small enough to be called "neural dust", and its functionality is attracting a lot of attention.

![Iota bio device](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/iota_product_blowup.png?w=1390&crop=1)

The main features of the device are its **size and ultrasound-based functionality**.

The company's small device can be **implanted anywhere in the body** and can capture and directly stimulate central nervous system data. This will allow doctors to treat diseases such as arthritis and cardiovascular disease more effectively.

In addition, data acquisition and other interactions with the device will be done using ultrasound. Therefore, unlike the devices offered by Neuralink and the other companies mentioned above, **it does not require batteries or wires**.

&nbsp;

The company was [acquired by Astellas Pharma in 2020 for $127.5 million](https://www.astellas.com/en/news/16126). Founder Jose Carmena and his team say that by working together, they can bring innovative new approaches to the management and treatment of diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

## [NeuroPace](https://www.neuropace.com/)

NeuroPace is a startup that offers **invasive BCI as a treatment for neurological conditions such as epilepsy.** The company's device [RNS® System](https://www.neuropace.com/patients/neuropace-rns-system/) monitors brain waves, recognizes a patient's unique "seizure onset footprint," and automatically generates and treats small amounts of electrical signals before symptoms occur.
The RNS® System is the **only FDA-approved device that responds to abnormal EEG signals to treat epilepsy**, and has been clinically tested on 191 patients at 31 epilepsy centers to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.

[![RNS System Intro](https://neurotechjp.com/img/5-startups-invasive-bci/neuropace.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2QLvuVqfNsA)
_Video: RNS System Intro_

The device can be implanted in the brain for approximately eight years, and experimental data showed that at the eight-year mark, the device reduced seizures by an **average of 73%**. In addition, of this group, **30% of patients achieved 90% seizure reduction or better in the most recent three months, and 29% had at least one period of 6 months or more without seizures.**

## Conclusion

In this article, we introduced five startups that have applied invasive BCI technology.

Unlike [non-invasive BCI](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/5-startups-non-invasive-bci/), invasive BCI requires deeper knowledge and expertise in neuroscience, so the total number of startups is small. However, several companies, led by Neuralink, are exploring the market with their abundant financial resources and innovative technologies.

With their success, there is a future where implanting devices in the brain will bring innovative experiences. On the other hand, as the FDA is regulating the sale of devices, there will be more and more concerns about the ethical aspects of "manipulating the brain".

We will continue to pay attention to what kind of services and innovations the invasive type will provide to the medical field.
