Consumer Brain-Computer Interface has been attracting attention in recent years, but how long have we had consumer BCI in our hands?

&nbsp;

Although BCIs have been studied for more than 30 years, the turning point in this field dates back more than 20 years. Then, invasive BCI research accelerated in the mid-1990s. [Cyberkinetics](https://www.braingate.org/), founded in 2001 by a team of researchers from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), provided the world's first consumer BCI "NeuroPort" two years after its establishment, enabling monitoring of the movement of the nervous system.

In the 2000s, when the first BCI was introduced to the market and they didn't see the light of day, **there was a pioneer company that developed the market by providing non-invasive BCI for consumers and combining it with entertainment.** That company is [NeuroSky](http://neurosky.com/), led by [Stanley Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanley-yang-8173602/), whom we interviewed this time.

&nbsp;

For this interview, we had the opportunity to talk with Stanley Yang, the CEO of NeuroSky that is a company that has been pioneering the Neurotech market for more than 10 years, about the history and future of the company: how they developed the market, and what their strategy is as a pioneer company in recent years under intense competition.

&nbsp;

## What is NeuroSky

![Neurosky logo](https://www.neurosky.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ns_logo_480.png)

Yang, who studied electrical engineering at UC Berkeley, has a talent for building gadgets, and in 1997 he founded [Triscend](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/triscend), a provider of chips including microprocessors, and the company was acquired by [Xilinx](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xilinx) in 2004. Later, he joined NeuroSky with [JongJin Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jongjin-lim-b740a11a/) and [KooHyoung Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koohyoung-lee-5742176/), who founded the company, in Silicon Valley in the same year.

&nbsp;

In 2009, NeuroSky collaborated with [Mattel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel) to launch [Mindflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindflex), a toy that uses brain waves to control a ball. In the same year, NeuroSky collaborated with [Uncle Milton](https://www.unclemilton.com/) to launch [Star Wars Science Force Trainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Trainer), a game that allows users to experience the Star Wars Force. So, in the early days of the company, they were active as an [OEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer). Based on those findings and experiences, the company then started offering a BCI called Mindset and a game ["Neuroboy"](https://store.neurosky.com/products/the-adventures-of-neuroboy-bci-technology-demo) that allows users to move objects with brain waves.

Currently, the company not only offers **[EEG devices](https://store.neurosky.com/)** that **can be purchased from $100 for consumers** but also provides **SDK kits** for developers free of charge. The company is also in the business of selling the **chips**, which is thier core technology, to a number of BCI companies.

&nbsp;

In addition, the company is expanding thier business **not only in the U.S. but also in Europe and Asia, and has raised more than $30 million dollars in total.**

&nbsp;

## Background on Successful Market Development. " Training the market first."

It is no exaggeration to say that it was the applications and devices provided by NeuroSky that first made BCI familiar to people in the 2000s.

Yang told me that **it took a lot of hard work to install the concept of BCI in people** as most people didn't know the word "brain waves"

> At that time, if I asked people to use a brainwave technology, or product, nobody knew what it was.
> Although the medical industry measured brainwaves, the general consumers had no idea how or why they should use a product measuring brainwaves.

&nbsp;

How did they introduce the concept of "brain waves" to more people and develop the market?

&nbsp;

As a breakthrough, **they trained the market by offering a toy that people were familiar with, the "Force" from Star Wars**.

> At that time, it was very difficult to convince customers to use a brainwave measuring product without obvious applications.
> That's why we went with "Star Wars" because they have the force that many people are familiar with.

> “The Force” replaced “brainwaves”. Then they became curious because everybody knew the force is not real. People investigated the technology behind the Force Trainer and found NeuroSky Brainwave EEG technology.
> That's called “training the market”
> ...
> We spent a lot of effort in training the market because we had to make people accept and understand our product. Many companies with great products failed to train the market and to make people understand their products
> ...
> It took a lot of effort to build products. Thanks to “triaing the market” strategy, we have been successful over the last 10 ~ 15 years in introducing our technology to the general public.

&nbsp;

**Making these "market training" the first step** is the key to success, Yang said.

> After many of these training, you can use the technology to do more things and then you have to make revenue and money.
> ...
> For example, I have the iPhone one. In the beginning, just four apps on the screen for a while, but now they have billions of apps.So at that time, they needed to train the market to understand the concept "this is the app".
> ...
> Even big companies can fail when they have new products. It's not because the technology is not good, or the idea is not good, or the application is not good. I've seen them fail because they fail to train the market. So, that's very important.
> If you have a brand new idea or product, nobody's seen it. So, you have to train the market to accept it at first.

&nbsp;

## Providing devices in the education domain and chips. What are the use cases?

NeuroSky has succeeded in training the market, but what should be done to make BCI more accessible to more people in the future?

&nbsp;

Yang answered that **providing good applications with a purpose is important.**

NeuroSky's focus now is on **educational** and **industrial** areas, providing devices not only for end-users but also for **organizations and businesses**.

> We are now very popular in some kind of practical application such as schools and gyms around the world that using a headset for education.
> Also, many construction companies around the world are now using our brainwave technology in the workers' helmets to monitor if they are in poor condition. It helps them prevent accidents and save their lives and save the company costs.

&nbsp;

The BCI offered by NeuroSky has only one electrode, and its accuracy and range of use cases are limited compared to other BCIs such as those introduced in [5 featured startups in non-invasive BCI](https://neurotechjp.com/blog/5-startups-non-invasive-bci/).

However, NeuroSky is not limited to providing their own devices, but also provides many companies with their own chips developed based on their experience and technology.

**By providing the chip itself to companies working on BCI development, they are collaborating** rather than competing, Yang explained.

> We just don't sell devices to consumers. We build our own chips and we have many collaborations with companies.
> They sell devices with multi-channels, but we're not competing against them. So we actually have many applications in partners.There are so many of these technologies that already use our chips, platforms to build out.  
> So some of these products you mentioned are not our competitors. They're actually our customers.

&nbsp;

## A platform company, and then to a biosensor company not limited to EEG.

NeuroSky has a unique position in the field of Neurotech by developing and providing chips, so what will be the future of NeuroSky?

&nbsp;

Yang told me that they will continue to be **a platform company** first.

> Apple has an app store for all the apps. So Apple focuses on building the phone. We build a brainwave technology platform, the hardware.
> We provide a platform just like the iPhone, and we don't let our business partners and our customers deployed their apps, but their applications on this platform.

&nbsp;

In addition, he said that they will adapt the AI and hardware technologies they have developed over the years **not only to EEG but also to biosensor chips**. As an example, they have worked with the government to develop a smartwatch that detects COVID-19 symptoms.

> We are not just providing brainwaves sensors, we also build basic biosensors.
> For example, we built a smartwatch. It much helps detect your conditions and then calculate the possibility that you have COVID.
> Now, we have another application in body sensors as well as watches. So we're now applying our base technology to other areas.

&nbsp;

## In conclusion

This time, we interviewed Stanley Yang, the founder of NeuroSky, who has been pioneering the Neurotech market for many years, about the story behind their success and future development.

Just as NeuroSky had a lot of trouble getting people to recognize the BCI when it was first launched, it is essential to train the market to provide people with technology that was thought to be unfeasible. These lessons may be necessary not only for Neurotech, but also for the social implementation of the latest technology in many other fields.
