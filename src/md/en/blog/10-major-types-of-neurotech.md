The technology of Neurotech is the result of many layers of research woven together by the history of various studies by our great predecessors.

When you first came into contact with Neurotech, you may have been fascinated by the BCI that connects the brain to the computer and imagined a future of science fiction.

In this series, however, we will explain the technical characteristics of the 10 major types of Neurotech technologies from a bird's eye view, not only BCI.

&nbsp;

In this article, we would like to introduce the first five technologies.

&nbsp;

## 1. Cognitive assessment & enhancing

![Cognitive assessment and enhancing](<https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/JMief1rFR5wFRogKp5KlMfHaFXk=/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alzheimers-and-montreal-cognitive-assessment-moca-98617-5bb7c858c9e77c0051582af1.png>)

&nbsp;

Cognitive assessment and enhancing is **a practice designed to help people improve their brain and cognitive development, social cognition, and increase vocational capabilities**.

&nbsp;

Over the past 30 years, amazing discoveries in neuroscience have opened up the future of our cognitive function. While cognitive function typically declines with age, **new neurotechnologies can improve brain health and performance.**

New research has shown that cognitive function can be assessed and enhanced through a variety of activities, including meditation, video games, smart drugs, nutritional supplements, nutrition, brain stimulation, exercise, music, and cognitive training.

When the cognitive function is enhanced, the brain becomes more efficient, allowing us to solve complex problems and understand new perspectives.

## 2. Neuropharmacology

&nbsp;

Neuropharmacology is **the study of** **both the treatment of curing sick people and improving their moods for the better**. Hence, it applies to everything from drugs prescribed to help the sick to the latest "smart drugs".

&nbsp;

Neuropharmacology can be broadly divided into **molecular neuropharmacology** and **behavioral neuropharmacology**.

Molecular neuropharmacology is the study of how drugs affect cellular functions and neural mechanisms with the aim of developing drugs with beneficial neurological effects, while behavioral neuropharmacology is the study of how drugs affect human behavior, including how drug dependence and addiction affect the human brain.

&nbsp;

Researchers at pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research hospitals **spend more than $137 billion per year to discover new neurotherapeutics**, and the pipeline is extremely inefficient, currently taking **more than 12 years and $1.5 billion to bring a drug to market**. The initial phase of R&D, before clinical trials begin, typically takes 3.5 years.

Companies that use this technology are represented by [Sage Therapeutics](https://www.sagerx.com/) and others.

&nbsp;

## 3. Neuromodulation

Neuromodulation is a "**changing in nervous activity through the delivery of stimulus**", a technique that alters neural activity by applying electrical or chemical stimuli to specific nerve sites in the body.

Neuromodulation is a diverse field, with applications ranging from diagnosis and treatment of various diseases to tools for medical and neuroscience research. It also includes pharmacological stimulation with drugs.

Each of those types of stimulation has different characteristics.

| **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation** | People with neurological symptoms such as headaches, and people with psychological symptoms such as depression |  Weak electric current generated by the sudden magnetic field change, which excites neurons in the brain.   |

&nbsp;

According to a market study by NeuroTech Reports, the global neuromodulation market is expected to grow from $8.4 billion in 2018 to **$13.3 billion by 2022**.

## 4. Neuromonitoring / imaging

Neuromonitoring/imaging is **a way to scan the brain and spinal cord**.

_Neuromonitoring/imaging types_

&nbsp;

### Neuroimaging

1. **MRI scan**

   MRI scan, which stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and brain stem.

2. **PET scan**

   PET scan, which stands for Positron Emission Tomography, is a tomography scan using a radioactive material called a tracer to examine the brain for disease or damage.

3. **CT scan**

   CT scan, which stands for Computed Tomography, is a type of X-ray examination that produces a three-dimensional image of the head, called a "slice".

&nbsp;

### Neuromonitoring

1. **EEG (ElectroEncephaloGraphy)**

   EEG can measure the electrical activity occurring in different cortical layers of the brain. EEG is used to record brain processes that occur immediately after visual or auditory stimulation, but it can also monitor brain states that reflect interaction and motivation over longer periods.

2. **MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy)**

   MEG is a functional neurotechnology that maps brain activity by recording the magnetic field produced by naturally occurring electrical currents in the brain using a highly sensitive magnetometer.

   While EEG detects the electrical activity produced by neural excitation, MEG captures the magnetic field produced by neural activity; MEG measurements are usually performed in a shielded chamber so that external magnetic fields do not interfere with the data recording.

   The biggest advantage is that MEG combines high temporal resolution similar to EEG, but with high spatial resolution.

&nbsp;

\*Temporal resolution: How short a time interval can be measured.

\*Spatial resolution: How well we can distinguish even the smallest objects.
&nbsp;

## 5. NeuroFeedback

![Neurofeedback](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/527026/fnhum-14-00192-HTML/image_m/fnhum-14-00192-g001.jpg)
_Neurofeedback flow_

&nbsp;

Neurofeedback is a technology **that visualizes brainwave activity in real-time and trains it, thereby changing brainwaves and leading to self-regulation of brain functions.**

By showing information about the patient's brain wave activity, the patient can learn to change his or her brain waves. Neurofeedback can be used to treat a variety of neurological conditions, such as ADHD, as well as to improve concentration and work productivity.

&nbsp;

According to Market Watch reports, the neurofeedback market is projected to be worth $43 million in 2019 and **$66 million by 2026**.

Companies that use this technology are represented by [Muse by InteraXon](https://choosemuse.com/) and others.

&nbsp;

## In conclusion

In this article, we introduced the first five of the ten technologies that represent Neurotech.

Although the technologies are based on research in pharmacology as well as brain science, there may be a market emerging like Neuromodulation where the scale is so large that it is becoming easier for startups to enter.

&nbsp;

In the next article, we will introduce the latter five technologies.
